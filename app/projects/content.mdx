### tido (in dev)
#### web-based project management app
This started as a really small todo list app, but slowly evolved into having more and more features. 
The current idea of it is that it's a one-stop-shop for all of your PM needs. Instead of having 
34 different apps that each have their own features, you can just have one.

I've worked on this project for around 4 years, and it survived probably twice as many rewrites. 
I've taken a different approach recently and decided to open-source it and take a more laidback approach to developing it.

Dev-wise, it's been fun to work on. In addition to applying new technologies, 
I've also been able to experiment with different design patterns and approaches to building a large-scale app.
I've taken a recent interest in hexagonal architecture, and I've been applying that to this project.

### DevGrid (in dev)
#### portfolio "grid" builder for developers
This was heavily inspired by Bento, and has pretty much the same idea. A lightweight portfolio builder that lets 
you create your own grid with customizable tiles.
There's even fancy tiles like social media links, GitHub contribution, and few other special ones.

### Candidate Pathways (in conjunction with CODE/+/TRUST)
#### E-Learning platform to teach people how to run for local political offices
This was the first project I lead at CODE/+/TRUST, and also one of the biggest application's I've ever worked on.
It currently supports a few thousand users across the US, most of which using the app every day.

It has a ton of features including a custom-built quiz engine, a forum-like 
discussion board, location-based office eligibility requirements, instant messaging, and a lot more.

This project required a ton of back-and-forth with the client, who had a very specific vision for the app. For the most part, I was 
responsible for communicating with the client about expectations, and then translating that into a technical plan for the team to execute.
