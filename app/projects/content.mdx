### tido (in dev)
#### web-based project management app
This started as a really small todo list app, but slowly evolved into having more and more features. 
The current idea of it is that it's a one-stop-shop for all of your PM needs. Instead of having 
34 different apps that each have their own features, you can just have one.

I've worked on this project for around 4 years, and it survived probably twice as many rewrites. It's on pause right now as I work on some other things, but I recently open-sourced it.

### DevGrid (in dev)
#### portfolio "grid" builder for developers
This was heavily inspired by Bento, and has pretty much the same idea. A lightweight portfolio builder that lets you create your own grid with customizable tiles.
There's even fancy tiles like social media links, GitHub contribution, and few other special ones.
